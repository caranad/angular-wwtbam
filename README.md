So I was inspired to make a "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" game that acted like one of those PowerPoint slide versions. I used Angular and Node.js to generate this project. 

Right now, Phone A Friend and Ask The Audience do not have any graphics, because I'm intending that you use this opportunity to interact with an actual person(s) to use this lifeline, rather than have the system provide you the answer.

When playing the game, you click once on an answer option to select as your final answer, and then twice to see the correct answer, and on the third time you would advance to the next question. I will be continually providing fixes to the program and general clean-ups of code architecture so that it functions well.

Questions are read from a Node.js server in JSON format.
